#### What is agentic ai

- In suppose traditional systems we have suppose a microservice for payment service, order service, shipping service and users will talk to the servers.
- Internally the services will interact with the databases
- In traditional systems if u want to add customer support u need manual way or need real people to handle things
- Those customer service people have access to payments details, order details, etc
- They have access to private info they can even change things
- We aim to automate those customer service people with AI
- The problem we have right now is - Openai , gemini are text-to-text models that is give input i will predict next set of output tokens
- How can these text to text models replace those people if they can't access servers and all
- They are basically right now very dumb
- We can convert them to agents , they will then have access to servers , they can look up in db, talk to users
- It has capability to NLP, means it understands u can communicate with you better
- Brain needs body to work
- LLM is brain without body
- We as devs can give them body
- Then it becomes an agent
